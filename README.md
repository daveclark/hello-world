# hello-world
Hello there,

I'm Dave, an adaptive IT asset with talents including customer support, analytical problem solving, project management, data conversions, database programming, and application deployment. Over 10 years of experience with medium and large organizations ranging from defense contract support to network administration and database programming.

I learned programming with Pascal and C++. I've programmed for client work on Robbins-Gioia CAT II flat file database, porting project management results to HTML. I've also done some healthcare integration work, using Javascript.
